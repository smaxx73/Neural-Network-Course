    "**Q1:** Our MLP uses MSE loss for XOR classification. What might be wrong with MSE for classification?\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "MSE treats all errors equally — an error of 0.1 is penalized the same whether the output is 0.5 or 0.99. But for classification, a confident **wrong** prediction (output 0.99 when target is 0) should be penalized much more harshly than an uncertain one (output 0.5). We need a loss function that understands **probabilities**.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:** If the network outputs 0.99 for a class-0 sample, how should the loss behave?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "The loss should be **very large** — almost infinite! The network is extremely confident and extremely wrong. MSE gives $(0 - 0.99)^2 = 0.98$, which is just... a number. Cross-entropy gives $-\\log(1 - 0.99) = -\\log(0.01) \\approx 4.6$, which is much steeper. This is what we need.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3:** What if we have 5 possible classes instead of 2? How should the output layer look?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "We need **5 output neurons**, one per class. Their outputs should be **probabilities that sum to 1**. This is exactly what the **softmax** function does!\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Sigmoid for probabilities**: Output of logistic regression is $P(y=1|\\mathbf{x})$  \n",
    "✅ **MSE fails for classification**: Slow gradients when sigmoid is saturated  \n",
    "✅ **Binary cross-entropy**: $-[y\\log\\hat{y} + (1-y)\\log(1-\\hat{y})]$ — steep penalty for wrong predictions  \n",
    "✅ **Softmax**: Turns $K$ logits into a probability distribution that sums to 1  \n",
    "✅ **Categorical cross-entropy**: $-\\log(\\hat{y}_c)$ — penalizes low probability for the correct class  \n",
    "✅ **Evaluation metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix  \n",
    "✅ **Decision threshold**: Tunable trade-off between precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Match loss to task:**\n",
    "   - Regression → MSE\n",
    "   - Binary classification → sigmoid + BCE\n",
    "   - Multi-class classification → softmax + CCE\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The gradient tells the story:**\n",
    "   - MSE + sigmoid: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} = 2(\\hat{y} - y) \\cdot \\sigma'(z)$ — saturates!\n",
    "   - BCE + sigmoid: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} = \\hat{y} - y$ — clean and strong\n",
    "   - CCE + softmax: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z_k} = \\hat{y}_k - y_k$ — same beautiful form\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accuracy is not enough:**\n",
    "   - Precision matters when false positives are costly\n",
    "   - Recall matters when false negatives are costly\n",
    "   - F1 balances both\n",
    "   - The confusion matrix shows the full picture\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 8: Generalization & Regularization**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next session, we'll learn:\n",
    "- **Train/validation/test splits**: How to evaluate honestly\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: When a model memorizes instead of learning\n",
    "- **Regularization**: L1, L2, dropout — tools to prevent overfitting\n",
    "- **Modern optimizers**: Momentum, Adam — beyond basic SGD\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal:** Build models that work on **new, unseen** data, not just the training set!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Next Session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about:**\n",
    "1. Our spiral classifier gets 95% accuracy on training data. Does that mean it will work well on new spirals?\n",
    "2. What if we increased the hidden layer to 500 neurons? Would that help or hurt?\n",
    "3. How would you know if your model is **too simple** vs **too complex**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional reading:**\n",
    "- Chapter 7 of Goodfellow et al., \"Deep Learning\" (Regularization)\n",
    "- Andrew Ng's \"Advice for applying ML\" lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**End of Session 7** 🎓\n",
    "\n",
    "**You now understand:**\n",
    "- ✅ How to build proper classification models with the right loss functions\n",
    "- ✅ How softmax and cross-entropy work together\n",
    "- ✅ How to evaluate classifiers beyond simple accuracy\n",
