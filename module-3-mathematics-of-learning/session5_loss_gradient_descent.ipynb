    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Loss Functions**: Measure \"how wrong\" predictions are (MSE)  \n",
    "✅ **Loss Landscapes**: Visualize loss as a surface over weight space  \n",
    "✅ **Derivatives**: The slope tells us which direction to move  \n",
    "✅ **Gradient**: Vector of partial derivatives — points toward steepest ascent  \n",
    "✅ **Gradient Descent**: Walk downhill by updating $w \\leftarrow w - \\eta \\nabla L$  \n",
    "✅ **SGD**: Use mini-batches for efficiency and implicit regularization  \n",
    "✅ **Linear Regression**: Trained with GD — same recipe used for neural networks!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loss + Gradient = Learning:**\n",
    "   - The loss function measures the error\n",
    "   - The gradient tells us how to reduce it\n",
    "   - Gradient descent applies the correction iteratively\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning rate matters:**\n",
    "   - Too small → slow convergence\n",
    "   - Too large → divergence\n",
    "   - Finding the right value is part of training\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The GD recipe is universal:**\n",
    "   - Works for any differentiable model + loss\n",
    "   - Same algorithm trains linear regression and deep neural networks\n",
    "   - The only hard part for MLPs: computing gradients for hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 6: Backpropagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next session, we'll learn:\n",
    "- **The chain rule**: How to compute gradients through multiple layers\n",
    "- **Backpropagation**: The algorithm that makes neural network training possible\n",
    "- **Training an MLP**: Finally train our XOR network automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal:** Compute $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W^{(l)}}$ for **any** layer, so we can train deep networks!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Next Session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about:**\n",
    "1. In a chain of functions $f(g(x))$, how would you compute $\\frac{df}{dx}$?\n",
    "2. If changing a hidden neuron's output by +0.1 increases the loss by +0.3, what is $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h}$?\n",
    "3. How would you \"pass\" the error from the output layer back to the hidden layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional reading:**\n",
    "- 3Blue1Brown: \"Gradient descent, how neural networks learn\" (YouTube)\n",
