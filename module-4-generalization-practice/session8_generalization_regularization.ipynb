    "✅ **Gradient descent & backpropagation**: Automatic weight learning (Sessions 5–6)  \n",
    "✅ **Classification**: Sigmoid/softmax, cross-entropy, evaluation metrics (Session 7)  \n",
    "✅ **Open question**: Our spiral classifier hits 95% on training data — but will it work on **new** data?\n",

    "### 🤔 Quick Questions (from Session 7's \"Think About\")\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "**Not necessarily.** The model may have **memorized** the training data instead of learning the underlying pattern. We need to test on data the model has never seen — this is the **generalization** problem.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:** What if we increased the hidden layer to 500 neurons?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "More neurons = more capacity to memorize. With 500 hidden neurons on a 300-sample spiral dataset, the model could fit every single point perfectly — including noise! It would likely **overfit**: perfect on training data, poor on new data.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3:** How would you know if your model is too simple vs too complex?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "Compare **training loss** vs **validation loss**. If training loss is low but validation loss is high, the model is too complex (overfitting). If both are high, the model is too simple (underfitting). This is what **learning curves** show us.\n",

    "\n",
    "The simplest regularization technique: **stop training when validation loss starts increasing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea: save the best weights (lowest validation loss), and restore them when patience runs out.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Regularization Techniques {#regularization}\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization = adding **constraints** or **penalties** to prevent the model from becoming too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as telling the model: \"Don't just fit the data — keep things **simple**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a penalty for large weights to the loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_{\\text{total}} = L_{\\text{data}} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_l \\| W^{(l)} \\|^2_F\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\lambda$ controls the regularization strength and $\\| W \\|^2_F = \\sum_{ij} w_{ij}^2$ is the Frobenius norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect on gradient:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial W^{(l)}} = \\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{data}}}{\\partial W^{(l)}} + \\lambda W^{(l)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The update becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W^{(l)} \\leftarrow (1 - \\eta\\lambda) W^{(l)} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{data}}}{\\partial W^{(l)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That factor $(1 - \\eta\\lambda)$ **shrinks** the weights at every step — hence the name **weight decay**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** Large weights create sharp, complex decision boundaries. Penalizing large weights encourages smoother, simpler boundaries that generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L1 Regularization (Sparsity)\n",
    "\n",

    "L_{\\text{total}} = L_{\\text{data}} + \\lambda \\sum_l \\| W^{(l)} \\|_1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference from L2:** L1 drives weights to **exactly zero**, creating sparse networks. L2 shrinks weights toward zero but rarely makes them exactly zero.\n",

    "- Forces the network to not rely on any single neuron\n",

    "2. **Rosenbrock:** Why does vanilla SGD barely move in 2000 steps? What does momentum do differently?\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Generalization**: Training accuracy ≠ real-world performance  \n",
    "✅ **Train/Val/Test splits**: The honest way to evaluate models  \n",
    "✅ **Learning curves**: The diagnostic tool for overfitting and underfitting  \n",
    "✅ **Early stopping**: Stop when validation loss increases, restore best weights  \n",
    "✅ **L2 regularization**: Penalize large weights → smoother boundaries  \n",
    "✅ **Dropout**: Randomly disable neurons → implicit ensemble  \n",
    "✅ **Modern optimizers**: Momentum smooths oscillations, Adam adapts per-weight\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The overfitting recipe:**\n",
    "   - Big model + small dataset + long training = memorization\n",
    "   - Detect with learning curves (train-val gap)\n",
    "   - Cure with: early stopping, regularization, more data, simpler model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regularization works by constraining complexity:**\n",
    "   - L2 keeps weights small → smooth decision boundaries\n",
    "   - Dropout prevents co-adaptation → robust features\n",
    "   - They can be combined for stronger effect\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimizer choice matters:**\n",
    "   - Adam is the safe default (fast, adaptive, forgiving)\n",
    "   - SGD + Momentum can generalize better with careful tuning\n",
    "   - Always compare on a validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 9: PyTorch Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next session, we'll learn:\n",
    "- **Tensors & autograd**: Automatic differentiation (no more manual backprop!)\n",
    "- **nn.Module**: Build networks declaratively\n",
    "- **Training loop**: Optimizers, loss functions, and datasets — the PyTorch way\n",
    "- **Rebuild**: Reimplement our MLP in PyTorch and compare\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal:** Transition from \"understanding the math\" to \"using professional tools\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Next Session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about:**\n",
    "1. We manually implemented backpropagation, gradient descent, L2, dropout, momentum, and Adam. What parts were tedious and error-prone?\n",
    "2. If a library could handle gradients automatically, what would you still need to implement yourself?\n",
    "3. Install PyTorch: `pip install torch` (or see https://pytorch.org)\n",
