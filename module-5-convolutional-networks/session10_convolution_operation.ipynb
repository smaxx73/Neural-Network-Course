    "### What We've Built So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **MLP**: Fully-connected layers with backprop (Sessions 2–8)  \n",
    "✅ **PyTorch**: Build and train networks with autograd (Session 9)  \n",
    "✅ **MNIST**: 97%+ accuracy on handwritten digits with an MLP  \n",

    "### 🤔 Quick Questions (from Session 9's \"Think About\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1:** Our MNIST MLP flattens the 28×28 image into a 784-dimensional vector. What spatial information is lost?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "**Neighbor relationships.** Pixel (0, 0) and pixel (0, 1) are right next to each other in the image, but in the flattened vector they're just index 0 and index 1 — the model has no way to know they're neighbors. Pixel (0, 0) and pixel (1, 0) are directly below each other in the image, but in the vector they're 28 positions apart. The 2D structure is completely destroyed.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:** For a 224×224 RGB image, how many parameters in the first hidden layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "Input: $224 \\times 224 \\times 3 = 150{,}528$ features. If the first hidden layer has 256 neurons:\n",
    "$$150{,}528 \\times 256 + 256 = 38{,}535{,}424 \\text{ parameters}$$\n",
    "That's **38.5 million parameters** in just the first layer! This is completely impractical — and it would massively overfit.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3:** When you recognize a digit, do you look at every pixel equally?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "No! You look at **local patterns**: curves, straight lines, intersections, loops. A \"6\" has a loop at the bottom and a curve at the top. A \"1\" is a vertical line. You recognize these **local features** regardless of where they appear in the image. This is exactly what convolutions do.\n",

    "## 2. Why MLPs Fail for Images {#mlp-fail}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1: Too Many Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "An MLP treats every pixel as an independent input feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Image (28×28 = 784 pixels)\n",
    "  ↓ flatten\n",
    "[p₁, p₂, p₃, ..., p₇₈₄]\n",
    "  ↓ fully-connected to 256 neurons\n",
    "Weight matrix: 784 × 256 = 200,704 parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For real images (224×224×3 = 150K inputs), this explodes to millions of parameters per layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 2: No Spatial Awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original image:             Flattened vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ┌─────────┐\n",
    "  │ . . X . │               [., ., X, ., ., ., X, X, ., ., ., X, ., ., ., .]\n",
    "  │ . X X . │  flatten →\n",
    "  │ . . X . │               The MLP sees pixels (0,2), (1,1), and (1,2) as\n",
    "  │ . . . . │               \"features 3, 6, 7\" — no notion of adjacency.\n",
    "  └─────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLP doesn't know that pixel 3 is **next to** pixel 4, or **above** pixel 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3: No Translation Invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "If a \"7\" appears in the top-left corner during training and in the bottom-right during testing, the MLP must learn both positions **separately** — because different pixels (different input features) are activated. It has no concept of \"the same pattern in a different location.\"\n",

    "| **Local connectivity** | Every neuron sees all pixels | Each neuron sees a small **patch** |\n",

    "## 10. Summary {#summary}\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Why MLPs fail for images**: Too many parameters, no spatial awareness, no translation invariance  \n",
    "✅ **Convolution operation**: Slide a kernel, compute local dot products  \n",
    "✅ **Output size formula**: $O = \\lfloor (H + 2p - k) / s \\rfloor + 1$  \n",
    "✅ **Padding**: Preserves spatial dimensions ($p = \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$ for \"same\" convolution)  \n",
    "✅ **Stride**: Controls downsampling (stride 2 ≈ halves the size)  \n",
    "✅ **Weight sharing**: Same kernel reused everywhere → massive parameter savings  \n",
    "✅ **Feature maps**: Each kernel produces a different \"view\" of the image  \n",
    "✅ **PyTorch nn.Conv2d**: Same operation, hardware-optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolution = local pattern detector:**\n",
    "   - A kernel is a template for a specific pattern (edge, blur, corner)\n",
    "   - Sliding it across the image finds that pattern **everywhere**\n",
    "   - That's why a \"7\" detector works regardless of position\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameter efficiency is dramatic:**\n",
    "   - A $3 \\times 3$ kernel has 9 parameters\n",
    "   - A fully-connected layer on a 224×224 image has millions\n",
    "   - CNNs achieve **better** results with **far fewer** parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical features emerge from stacking:**\n",
    "   - Layer 1: edges, gradients\n",
    "   - Layer 2: corners, textures (combinations of edges)\n",
    "   - Layer 3+: parts, objects (combinations of combinations)\n",
    "   - This mirrors how the human visual cortex works\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 11: Building CNNs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next session, we'll learn:\n",
    "- **Pooling layers**: Downsample feature maps while keeping important info\n",
    "- **CNN architecture patterns**: Conv → ReLU → Pool → ... → Flatten → FC\n",
    "- **LeNet-5**: The classic CNN architecture (1998!)\n",
    "- **Training CNNs on MNIST**: Beat our MLP from Session 9\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal:** Assemble convolutions into a complete image classifier!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Next Session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about:**\n",
    "1. After two $3 \\times 3$ convolutions (no padding), a $28 \\times 28$ image becomes $24 \\times 24$. After ten such layers, what size would it be? Is this a problem?\n",
    "2. Our MNIST MLP achieved ~97% accuracy. Do you think a CNN can do better? Why?\n",
    "3. We hand-designed edge kernels. In a CNN, the kernels are **learned** by backpropagation. What loss function guides them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional reading:**\n",
    "- Stanford CS231n: \"Convolutional Neural Networks\" lecture notes\n",
    "- Distill.pub: \"Feature Visualization\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**End of Session 10** 🎓\n",
    "\n",
    "**You now understand:**\n",
    "- ✅ Why images need specialized architectures\n",
    "- ✅ How the convolution operation works (by hand and in code)\n",
