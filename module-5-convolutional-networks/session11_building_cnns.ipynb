    "### What We Know\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Convolution**: Slide a kernel, compute local dot products → feature map (Session 10)  \n",
    "✅ **Padding & stride**: Control output size; $O = \\lfloor (H + 2p - k)/s \\rfloor + 1$ (Session 10)  \n",
    "✅ **Feature maps**: Each kernel detects one type of pattern (Session 10)  \n",
    "✅ **PyTorch**: `nn.Conv2d`, `nn.Module`, training loop (Sessions 9–10)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Quick Questions (from Session 10's \"Think About\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1:** After two $3 \\times 3$ convolutions (no padding), a $28 \\times 28$ image becomes $24 \\times 24$. After ten such layers, what size would it be?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "Each layer shrinks the image by 2 in each dimension: $28 \\to 26 \\to 24 \\to 22 \\to 20 \\to 18 \\to 16 \\to 14 \\to 12 \\to 10 \\to 8$. After 10 layers: $8 \\times 8$. After 14 layers it would reach $0 \\times 0$ — impossible! This is why we need **padding** or a way to **intentionally** reduce size (pooling) rather than losing it accidentally.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2:** Can a CNN beat our MLP's ~97% on MNIST?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "Yes! State-of-the-art CNNs achieve **99.7%+** on MNIST. Even simple CNNs easily reach **99%+**. The spatial structure that MLPs ignore is exactly what CNNs exploit. We'll see this today.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3:** What loss function guides learned kernels?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>\n",
    "The same `CrossEntropyLoss` we've been using! The kernels are just parameters — backpropagation computes $\\partial L / \\partial K$ for every kernel weight, and the optimizer updates them. No one tells the network to learn edge detectors — it discovers them because edges help minimize classification loss.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Missing Piece\n",
    "\n",
    "We can detect features with convolutions. But to classify an image, we need to go from feature maps to a class label:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input image → [Feature extraction] → [Classification]\n",
    "  28×28          Conv layers             FC layers → 10 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "We know this part (Session 10)     We know this part (Session 9)\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Pooling Layers {#pooling}\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "After several convolutions, we have many feature maps at full (or nearly full) resolution. This is:\n",
    "- **Expensive**: Too many values to process\n",
    "- **Fragile**: Features tied to exact pixel positions\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way to **reduce spatial dimensions** while keeping the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Max Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max pooling** slides a window across the feature map and keeps only the **maximum value** in each window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input (4×4):                Max Pool 2×2, stride 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1  3  2  1                ┌─────┬─────┐\n",
    "  4  6  5  2      →        │max  │max  │     6  5\n",
    "  7  2  3  1                │ 4,6 │ 5,2 │     8  4\n",
    "  8  1  4  3                ├─────┼─────┤\n",
    "                            │max  │max  │\n",
    "                            │ 8,2 │ 4,3 │\n",
    "                            └─────┴─────┘\n",
    "\n",
    "  Output (2×2): halved in each dimension!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties:**\n",
    "- Reduces spatial size (typically by half: $2 \\times 2$ pool, stride 2)\n",
    "- **Keeps the strongest activation** in each region\n",
    "- Provides a small amount of **translation invariance** (the \"6\" can shift by 1 pixel and the max is still 6)\n",
    "- **No learnable parameters!** It's a fixed operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the maximum, take the **mean** of each window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Same input:                 Avg Pool 2×2, stride 2:\n",

    "### ✏️ Exercise 9.3 — Analysis Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer in your notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which architecture achieved the best accuracy?** Is the best one also the biggest?\n",
    "2. **TinyCNN has only 1 conv layer.** How does it compare to the Session 9 MLP? What does this tell you about the value of even a single convolution?\n",
    "3. **DeepCNN has 3 conv layers.** Did it beat LeNet-5? After pooling 3 times ($28 \\to 14 \\to 7 \\to 3$), the feature maps are only $3 \\times 3$. Is this too small?\n",
    "4. **WideCNN uses dropout in the FC layer.** Based on Session 8, why is this a good idea here?\n",
    "5. You have a new task: classify $64 \\times 64$ RGB images into 100 classes. Based on what you've learned, sketch an architecture (layers, filter sizes, channels). How many conv+pool blocks would you use?\n",

    "## 10. Summary {#summary}\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Max pooling**: Keep strongest activations, reduce spatial dimensions by half  \n",
    "✅ **CNN architecture**: Conv→ReLU→Pool (feature extractor) → Flatten → FC (classifier)  \n",
    "✅ **The funnel**: Channels grow, spatial dims shrink  \n",
    "✅ **LeNet-5**: The classic CNN — 44K parameters, 99%+ on MNIST  \n",
    "✅ **DataLoader**: Batch training on full datasets  \n",
    "✅ **Data augmentation**: Random transforms to improve generalization  \n",
    "✅ **Feature map visualization**: See what each filter detects  \n",
    "✅ **Architecture experiments**: Deeper, wider, and smaller variants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CNNs beat MLPs on images by exploiting spatial structure:**\n",
    "   - Fewer parameters through weight sharing\n",
    "   - Translation invariance through convolutions + pooling\n",
    "   - Hierarchical features through stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What CNNs learn automatically:**\n",
    "   - Layer 1: Edge detectors (just like our Sobel kernels from Session 10!)\n",
    "   - Layer 2: Combinations of edges → corners, curves, textures\n",
    "   - FC layers: Combine spatial features into class predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Architecture matters, but not as much as you'd think:**\n",
    "   - Even a tiny 1-conv-layer CNN beats an MLP\n",
    "   - Going deeper helps, but with diminishing returns on simple tasks\n",
    "   - Wider (more filters) can be as effective as deeper\n",

    "Session 6:  Backpropagation    → trains deep networks\n",
    "Session 7:  Softmax + CCE      → multi-class classification\n",
    "Session 8:  Regularization     → prevents overfitting\n",
